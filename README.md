### Beep Boop!

Poke me on twitter if you work on something interesting in web3.

Solidity/JS/TS/NodeJS/EVM/Python/Distributed Systems/Full Stack.

Currently I focus protocol design (eg. vaults or stablecoins existing mechanisms and different extensions) related projects.

I like new web3 primitives and automation with node/cloud.

Lack time to dig into security.
